        "description_html": "<p>The purpose of Alpha Chi Sigma is reflected in the three objects of the Fraternity, which express the true ideals of all its members.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>1. To bind its members with a tie of true and lasting friendship.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2. To strive for the advancement of Chemistry both as a science and as a profession.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3. To aid its members by every honorable means in the attainment in their ambitions as chemists throughout their mortal lives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There is no organization quite comparable to a professional fraternity. Socially, it presents members with the opportunity of meeting those interested in their work. Fraternal bonds are ever so much stronger than professional ones, but there are no bonds as strong as those created through combined fraternal and professional interests. Members of Alpha Chi Sigma, many of whom are leaders in the industrial and scientific world, all share common fraternal ideals. Purely professional organizations such as the American Chemical Society and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers have their place, and Alpha Chi Sigma constantly encourages its members to become active in these organizations. Social fraternities also offer much to the student, but only a professional fraternity&mdash;and Alpha Chi Sigma is the only national professional chemistry fraternity in the United States--can provide the college student and the professional in chemistry and related fields with the interests and bonds of a fraternity.</p>\r\n<p><em>All chapter-sanctioned events for the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters will be held in accordance with both university and state public health guidelines. </em></p>\r\n<p>We perform rush events at the beginning of both the Fall and Spring semesters. These events introduce prospective members to the organization, and what would be required of them as a pledge of Alpha Chi Sigma. The pledging process will last about 2 months and will consist of pledge bonding activities, education about the fraternity, and participation in Alpha Chi Sigma's professional and philanthropic activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Undergraduate pledges are no longer required to achieve a minimum amount of credit hours in the Chemical sciences and are only requested to have a passion for Chemistry. Our most common majors are Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Biochemistry, and Biology, but Biological Systems Engineering, Environmental Science and some Agribusiness, Animal and Poultry Science, Crop and Soil Environmental Science, Dairy Science, Food Science and Technology, Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise and Wood Science majors can also join, as well as anyone with a Chemistry minor. See the documents page for a full list of required options for these majors. We cannot pledge first semester freshmen or graduating seniors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Graduate students, faculty members, and members of the community may pledge if in a field where chemistry predominates. Pledging requirements are much less time-intensive for professional pledges. There are currently 13 graduate student and 15 faculty member brothers, and there is a Southwest Virginia Professional Group.</p>",

Strong Individuals Striving Together As Sisters (SISTAS) was established by co-founders Tina Park and Alice Vuong with the intention of laying the foundation for a chapter of the sorority on campus. Following their belief that the sorority would provide Asian American women with a support system not otherwise found on campus, the ladies of SISTAS worked persistently to become a group that would acquire the respect and interest from the Virginia Tech campus, surrounding community of Blacksburg, and the existing chapters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Joined by Kokoro Fujiyama, Marylynn Jansak, Nicole Shin, Erica Sok, Carol Tsai, Hannah Xiu, and Melody Yok; the 9 women worked together to lay the foundation of friendship and sisterhood. Through their dedicated efforts, the ladies of SISTAS impacted the community with their message of Asian Awareness, sisterhood and charity. In the Spring of 2002, the sisters of the Theta Chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi at the University of Pennsylvania, the first full-fledged chapter on the East Coast, was granted the privilege of hosting the pledging colony of Virginia Tech. After almost a year of work in addition to the continued support of their host chapter, UPenn, and New Member Educator, Margaret Shea, the ladies at Virginia Tech were able to realize their own potential and abilities while reaching their long-held goals.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On April 14, 2002, the ladies of SISTAS proudly became the 32nd chapter of the nation&rsquo;s largest and most prestigious Asian American sorority, alpha Kappa Delta Phi. Now, loving and devoted sisters of the Alpha Theta Chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi at Virginia Tech work together to continue to grow as individuals and as sisters, through love and everlasting friendship! \ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc9c</p>\r\n<div id=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_jp-post-flair\" class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_sharedaddy x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_sd-like-enabled x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_sd-sharing-enabled\">&nbsp;</div>",

        "description_html": "\r\n<h2>History of Alpha Psi</h2>\r\n<p>In 1906 veterinary students at Ohio State University saw the benefits of fraternal life but were frustrated by the lack of a national organization for their profession. After much study and work, 22 Juniors and Seniors founded the Alpha Chapter of Alpha\r\n Psi Fraternity and by 1915 chapters had been established at 15 schools. Today, there are eleven active Alpha Psi Chapters at veterinary schools across the country.If an honor roll were established for the all time leaders of the veterinary profession in the\r\n United States, it would be heavily weighted with Alpha Psi Fraternity Members. Certainly their accomplishments are the result of individual initiative and merit but in some instances leadership and communicative skills were strengthened by their fraternity\r\n experience.</p>\r\n<h3>The preamble to the Alpha Psi Fraternity constitution reads as follows:</h3>\r\n<p>&quot;We, students of the College of Veterinary Medicine of the Ohio State university, in order to promote a stronger bond between the veterinary colleges of the United States and Canada; to create a better feeling among the students of all veterinary colleges,\r\n and to infuse a deeper interest in the study of veterinary science, do hereby establish this constitution for the ALPHA PSI, the national veterinary fraternity.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>The constitution was written in 1907 and the objectives stated then are appropriate today. Alpha Psi is a social-professional fraternity which restricts its active membership to students who are enrolled in a school of veterinary medicine. It provides an\r\n opportunity for the development of lasting friendships between individuals in different classes or schools and is dedicated to the development of these individuals to better serve the veterinary profession.</p>\r\n<h3>History of Alpha Psi at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine</h3>\r\n<p>In early 1983, the Pi Chapter of Alpha Psi was founded at VMRCVM. Two individuals, Jim McDonald and Paul Howard, were instrumental in getting the chapter established. Members of the Lambda Chapter and National Officers of Alpha Psi conducted the first induction\r\n establishing 96 charter members of the Pi Chapter.</p>\r\n",

With NASA's current objective of using the moon as a checkpoint to interplanetary travel and colonization, locating water is highly important.\r\n During a previous design cycle, 2022\u20132023, our objective was to design and construct a lunar robot capable of autonomously navigating rugged terrain and mining icy regolith. The robot then had to return to the starting point and deposit the mined material.\r\n This objective helps NASA use the icy regolith beneath the surface for life-sustaining purposes. The competition also included presenting our final design and a systems paper describing the vital decisions that went into the team's design.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For the 2023\u20132024 season, we designed and built a robot that can construct a lunar regolith-based berm.

We perform testing trials and research to determine which design will be used\r\n for the competition. We use CNC routers and 3D modeling software to design and develop our canoe hull. In the spring semester, construction begins in the VT Structures Lab. The canoe hull is developed and the concrete is hand placed. The canoe then cures for\r\n 28 days in the form, is removed, sanded, and finished. We then present our work at the ASCE VA Section Regional Competition and have the opportunity to race our canoe, with the chance of advancing to the national ASCE competition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Although civil engineering is the primary focus of the design team, the team is in need of engineers from all disciplines!

It is a water access and sanitation project for a community in Western Kenya. We have already implemented a hand pump in the Masara Steel Community in Migori County. We\r\n are working towards monitoring the well and building a second well. Eventually we want to make both wells solar powered for easier use/access. This project has brought clean and accessible water to the community and we are continuing to help improve their\r\n situation.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Uganda Project:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Uganda Project team has been working on providing electricity to rural communities in Uganda by implementing small scale solar systems for 13 years. In August of 2019, a group of five students from the Uganda Project along\r\n with Professional Engineer Phil Powell and KBJW Vice President Brent Johnson, two members of the Central Virginia EWB Chapter, traveled to rural southwest Uganda. There, the team worked at St. Michael\u2019s Primary School to help finish the installation of a 10-panel\r\n solar power system. The system powered the lighting around campus and a 10 student computer lab that was\r\n</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">also installed by the VT Uganda Team</span><span style=\"font-weight:400\">. The team also surveyed St. Michael's and uncovered their challenges with supplying clean water. In 2022, a 4kW solar power system was installed at\r\n a second school, Kshek Jr. School. It provides indoor lighting and outdoor security lighting to the schools grounds. In 2023 we are working towards water implementation at Kshek to bring them clean water, which is healthier then the current turbid water flowing\r\n directly from the River Atar to the schools reservoir.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Kenya Bridge</span></p>\r\n<p>New project for 2025-2026!

Smith University), agreed to become the chapter\r\n advisor.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, in October of 1977, Third District Representative Bro. Charles Chambliss held the first Smoker on Virginia Tech\u2019s campus. &nbsp;The interesting aspect of the first open Smoker was more women attended than men. &nbsp;At the Smoker, Bro. Chambliss told all\r\n interested men to present their case for the establishment of a chapter during the 1978 Third District meeting in Natural Bridge, Va. &nbsp;Three young earnest individuals: Barry Griffin, Stan Harris and Peter Holmes set out on a road trip to seek Omega.&nbsp; After\r\n a two-hour journey, Bro. Chambliss met with them and told them he would discuss their case with the Third District leadership. &nbsp;After traveling two hours, the enthusiastic undergrads wanted to plead their own case! Bro. Chambliss told them to go back to Blacksburg\r\n and wait. &nbsp;They left with great anticipation.</p>\r\n<p>Before the end of the following spring quarter in 1978, Bro. Alfred Prunty of the Gamma Alpha Chapter in Roanoke, Virginia contacted the three enthusiasts.&nbsp; He informed them that they needed to get all paperwork together for a fall 1978 pledge line. &nbsp;In\r\n October 1978, Gamma Alpha inducted Rick Monroe, Stan Harris, Barry Griffin, Peter Holmes, D.K. Brockett, Darrell Davis and Wayne Robinson into its Lampados Club. &nbsp;The line name was Genesis.</p>\r\n<p>On January 26, 1979, Stan Harris, Barry Griffin, Peter Holmes and D.K. Brockett crossed the burning sands.&nbsp; On January 30, 1979, Rick Monroe was initiated.&nbsp; Though three more members were necessary to create a charter, the new brothers conducted all fraternity\r\n business under the name The Omegas of Blacksburg. &nbsp;The officers were: Bro. Barry Griffin, Basileus; Bro. Peter Holmes, Vice-Basileus; Bro. Stan Harris, Keeper of Records and Seals; and Bro. D. K. Brockett, Keeper of Finance.</p>\r\n<p>The first pledge line of the Omegas of Blacksburg was the duo of Boo-Boo and Sir Laugh A Lot otherwise known as Dennis Scott and Larry Fallen. &nbsp;They were initiated into the fold on May 27, 1979. &nbsp;On September 22, 1979, Wayne Robinson, was initiated. &nbsp;The\r\n Omegas of Blacksburg now had the eight men necessary to officially establish an undergraduate chapter. &nbsp;Third District Representative Bro. Kenny Brown officially chartered the Eta Lambda Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. on September 22, 1979. &nbsp;The\r\n first chapter officers were: Bro. Stanley Alvin Harris, Basileus; Bro. Barry Ivan Griffin, Vice-Basileus; Bro. Peter Everett Holmes, Keeper of Records and Seals; Bro. Donald Keith Brockett, Keeper of Finance and Bro. Ricky David Monroe, Keeper of the Peace.</p>\r\n",

We will host a variety of outreach events both in and outside of the museum so we can get more people engaged in the world of geosciences. We organize events on museum curation and the involvement of arts in science to promote science communication. We also take club field trips to local museums and schools to learn more about their collections as well as to learn how we can improve our own. We hold all these events and more with the singular purpose of making the museum the best version of itself that it could possibly be to serve as a tool for education and science-communication. We welcome all, whether you are well versed in the world of geoscience or are just eager to learn!</span></p>",

        "description_html": "\r\n<p>The motto of the German Club, Leadership for Service through Fellowship, describes the focus of the club. One of the club's primary goals is service to the University and local communities. Members of the club dedicate hundreds of man-hours annually for\r\n service projects such as holiday parties for under-privileged children, Special Olympics, the Christmas Store, and campus and community clean-ups. Devotion to Virginia Tech and leadership development become natural consequences of German Club membership. Our\r\n members are active in leadership positions in academic societies, the Corps of Cadets, the student body and government, residence halls, and many other aspects of student life. Founded as a social organization, the German Club continues to promote fellowship\r\n with socials with sororities, club parties, and the traditional Midwinter's Dance.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div align=\"left\">\r\n<h3>The German Club Ritual</h3>\r\n<p>The German Club Ritual is a document that describes the meaning behind each of these letters and defines the obligations of the German Club and its members.&nbsp; This document is the backbone to the German Club's membership decision making process.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The letters that spell GERMAN mean infinitely more than mere symbols of the alphabet to the German Club and to each German Club member. G-E-R-M-A-N signify attributes that are pillars of strength. Upon them is built the German Club. You must not only know\r\n them; you must live them, exemplify them. It is your definite obligation, your positive duty, so long as you are a German Club member to strengthen these six pillars. They are:</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"color:#660066; font-size:18px\">G</span></em></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#660066\"> stands for Gentleman</span></strong>. Be first of all a gentleman at all times. The true German Club man bespeaks the manners, culture and\r\n good breeding that mark the true gentleman. See to it that your own conduct rather than other men's words should praise you. Good manners and good morals go hand in hand, and gentlemanly conduct is everywhere a passport to the high regard of worthy people.\r\n In flaming words shines the German doctrine: When dignity is lost, and honor dies, the man is dead.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"color:#660066; font-size:18px\">E</span></em></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#660066\"> stands for Earnestness</span></strong>. The German Club man is earnest in his efforts, diligent in the duties of membership. Work earnestly\r\n always for the good of the German Club. If you have great talents, earnest work will improve them; if but moderate abilities, earnest industry will supply their deficiencies. Nothing is denied to well-directed labor and earnest work; nothing is ever to be\r\n attained without them.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"color:#660066; font-size:18px\">R</span></em></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#660066\"> stands for Reputation and Responsibility</span></strong>. The two are inseparably linked, one with the other. The Reputation of the German\r\n Club is a glorious heritage bequeathed by those German Club men who have gone before you. This proud and honorable Reputation comes to you as a vibrant challenge out of the past and into the present to summon from this moment forward the very best that is\r\n within you. With you we now share the mantle of Responsibility to guard and to uphold this Reputation. The high Reputation of the German Club is your Responsibility, not alone to keep but also to enrich by your words and your deeds.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"color:#660066; font-size:18px\">M</span></em></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#660066\"> stands for Manhood</span></strong>. In all that the word implies, be a Man. Do the manly things. Do what your Manhood bids that you do, from\r\n none but self expect applause. It is not what you have but what you are that expresses your worth as a Man. The German Club expects you always to be a Man. It expects you to love truth, hate wrong, and respect others as you do yourself. &nbsp;Never forget this\r\n truth, namely: One cannot always be a hero, but one can always be a Man.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#660066\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><em>A</em></span> stands for Aim</span></strong>. &nbsp;The German Club has a definite Aim. &nbsp;We dedicate ourselves, by earnest work and unflagging zeal, to provide dances that are of the highest\r\n credit to our Club and to our Alma Mater. &nbsp;Through the loyalty of us all to our Club and through unbreakable bonds of brotherly love, we seek to promote good fellowship among us. &nbsp;The enrichment of our own lives and the enrichment of our Alma Mater must forever\r\n be our Aim, our common goal. &nbsp;See to it that our social functions are chastened by culture and dignity. &nbsp;Make certain that our good fellowship continues firm and constant. &nbsp;Remember always that the only way to have a friend is to be one.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#660066\"><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><em>N</em></span> stands for Name</span></strong>. &nbsp;The good Name of the German Club, as of yourself, must be a priceless treasure for you to guard forever. &nbsp;Do your part to assure that the\r\n German Club not only possesses a good Name, but deserves one. &nbsp;Never forget that a good Name is the greatest gift that we of the Club can leave to the German Club men of tomorrow. &nbsp;Build this Name upon Honor and Hospitality. &nbsp;Upon Honor because without Honor,\r\n which means fair-dealing, truth, and integrity, the German Club cannot fulfill its worthy mission. &nbsp;With Honor there is power. &nbsp;Upon Hospitality because the German Club always has been and will be the host, and graciousness to our guests is our duty and obligation.\r\n &nbsp;And you must not only enhance this good Name of the German Club, but also guard it always. &nbsp;It is, alas, all too true that a good Name is the result of many actions and lost by one.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

In a social aspect, we embark on fun geography based activities such as geo-caching, hiking, technological games/activities (i.e. geo-guesser), and environment-based service events. We are excited to promote and dive into all interests of geography, since they span vast areas of study.</p>",

In particular, the code is founded on the concept of honesty with respect to the intellectual efforts of oneself and others. Compliance with the Graduate Honor Code requires that all graduate students exercise honesty and ethical behavior in all their academic pursuits at Virginia Tech, whether these undertakings pertain to study, course work, research, extension, or teaching.</p>\r\n<p>It is recognized that graduate students have very diverse cultural backgrounds. In light of this, the term&nbsp;<em>ethical behavior&nbsp;</em>is defined as conforming to accepted professional standards of conduct, such as codes of ethics used by professional societies in the United States to regulate the manner in which their professions are practiced. The knowledge and practice of ethical behavior shall be the full responsibility of the student. Graduate students may, however, consult with their major professors, department heads,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://grads.vt.edu/igss/general_info/contacts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">International Graduate Student Services</a>, or the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.grads.vt.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Graduate School</a>&nbsp;for further information on what is expected of them.</p>\r\n<p>More specifically, all graduate students, while being affiliated with Virginia Tech, shall abide by the standards established by Virginia Tech, as these are described in the<a href=\"http://ghs.grads.vt.edu/ghs_constitution.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;GHS Constitution</a>. Graduate students, in accepting admission, indicate their willingness to subscribe to and be governed by the Graduate Honor Code and acknowledge the right of the University to establish policies and procedures and to take disciplinary action (including suspension or expulsion) when such action is warranted. Ignorance shall be no excuse for actions which violate the integrity of the academic community.</p>\r\n<p>The fundamental beliefs underlying and reflected in the Graduate Honor Code are that (1) to trust in a person is a positive force in making a person worthy of trust, (2) to study, perform research, and teach in an environment that is free from the inconveniences and injustices caused by any form of intellectual dishonesty is a right of every graduate student, and (3) to live by an Honor System, which places a positive emphasis on honesty as a means of protecting this right, is consistent with, and a contribution to, the University's quest for truth.</p>\r\n<p>The Graduate Honor System was established to implement the Graduate Honor Code, and its functions shall be:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>To promote honesty and ethical behavior in all academic pursuits, including, but not limited to, study, research, teaching, and extension.</li>\r\n<li>To disseminate information concerning the Graduate Honor System to all new graduate students, faculty, and other interested parties.</li>\r\n<li>To investigate all suspected violations of the Graduate Honor Code in an impartial, thorough, and unbiased manner.</li>\r\n<li>To try all cases involving academic infractions of the Graduate Honor Code brought before the System.</li>\r\n<li>To assure that the rights of all involved parties are protected and assure due process in all proceedings.</li>\r\n</ol>",

With social media, school, and the endless negative factors on mental health, it is more important than ever to slow this trend.&nbsp; Stepping up to get help is nearly impossible for people who are in need. Because of a negative stigma associated with mental health, they feel embarrassed or invalid. Creating a free and accessible form of help is necessary. IfYourAreReadingThis is an online resource that allows students to read and relate to letters written by students and faculty at Virginia Tech and many more colleges around the country. It is a no-commitment necessary resource that could be a stepping stone for students who are thinking about reaching out for help. School is a huge factor that contributes to anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts but we want to contribute to the slow of these things as much as possible. IfYouAreReadingThis will be a therapeutic resource for those wanting to express themselves in the form of a letter and for those looking for a story to read and relate with.

For example, careers fairs\r\n for aerospace students usually do not have a single company/organization that would be willing to hire international students. IASA would work with university and department officials to talk to industry partners and bring in more job opportunities for foreign\r\n students. Through IASA, the aim is to tackle these issues and support the international Aerospace community through available resources. The organization is in the process of working towards such small and big issues as well as expanding to form a cohesive\r\n network for knowledge flow.</p>\r\n<p>IASA is planning to address these issues in following ways</p>\r\n<p>1. IASA plans to conduct seminars and information sessions for international students. We would require the ability to reserve space as well as have adequate funding to organize such events on campus.<br>\r\n2. IASA would also need to talk to industry partners as well as university officials for helping with career fairs as well as engaging with professional organizations from other universities. Here RSO status of IASA will bolsters the credibility of the association\r\n and makes it easier to execute these tasks.<br>\r\n3.

Being a university RSO with student representatives from the university will be the first step towards that process.</p>\r\n",

        "description_html": "\r\n<p>Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated was founded on the night of January 5th, 1911 in Bloomington, Indiana at Indiana University. It was initially chartered and incorporated as Kappa Alpha Nu on May 15, 1911 making it the first NPHC organization to be\r\n incorporated. The name was later changed to Kappa Alpha Psi on April 15, 1915 by a proclamation by the Grand Polemarch, Elder Watson Diggs. Thus making Kappa Alpha Psi a Greek letter organization in every sense of the designation.</p>\r\n<p>The fraternity's fundamental purpose is ACHIEVEMENT in every field of human endeavor. Early in this century, African-American students were actively dissuaded from attending college. Formidable obstacles were erected to prevent the few who were enrolled\r\n from assimilating into co-curricular campus life. This ostracism characterized Indiana University in 1911, thus causing Elder W. Diggs, Byron K. Armstrong, and eight other black students to form Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, which remains the only Greek letter\r\n organization with its 1st Chapter on the University's campus.</p>\r\n<p>Objectives of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. are as follows:</p>\r\n<p>1. To unite college men of culture, patriotism, and honor in a bond of fraternity.</p>\r\n<p>2. To encourage honorable ACHIEVEMENT in every field of human endeavor.</p>\r\n<p>3. To promote spiritual, social, intellectual, and moral welfare of its members.</p>\r\n<p>4. To assist in the aims and purposes of colleges and universities.</p>\r\n<p>5. To inspire service in the public interest.</p>\r\n",

As a roster of roughly 25 students (selective membership through tryouts), we participate in various club basketball tournaments throughout the year. These tournaments are mostly in states along\r\n the east coast. Over the past few years, tournament locations have included JMU, UMD, NC State, University of Delaware, UNC, etc. We also occasionally play against postgraduate and basketball prep schools in the Hahn Hurst Basketball Practice Center. Opponents\r\n we have played against include Hargrave Military Academy, Fishburne Military Academy, Davidson Community College, and Charis Prep School. Many of these teams have players that contain future NCAA Division I, II, and III players. We will also be doing fundraisers\r\n to raise money for the season and may occasionally have social events with other club teams or sororities here at Virginia Tech. For clarification, we are a Registered Student Organization (RSO) under Virginia Tech. An RSO is defined as \u201ca voluntary association\r\n of Virginia Tech students that has no direct relationship to the university but upon completion of registration documents are entitled to certain privileges to include operating, meeting, advertising, and participating in activities on the Virginia Tech campus.\u201d\r\n This means that we are not<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a \u201cVT Sports Club\u201d, also classified as a University Student Life Program (USLP), meaning that we are not under the Department of Virginia Tech Recreational Sports. We are not entitled to get funding from the Department\r\n of Sport Clubs, and therefore, we must budget and manage ourselves appropriately without their help and request funding from the RSO Budget Board. However, despite not being an official Club Sport, we are a fully functional and competitive club basketball\r\n team playing against other university club teams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For all information please view our Instagram page. https://www.instagram.com/clubballvt/?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA%3D%3D</p>\r\n",

Sullivan believed that the division and university should recognize the important contribution of the leaders of major student organizations by creating a special honor society. There were originally thirteen student organizations installed as charter members. The order was founded as an undergraduate honor society, but as time passed and the influence of graduate student organizations grew, there was a groundswell of support to include graduate organizations. These were added in mid-1990. In the fall of 2013, under the leadership of the vice president for student affairs, Patricia A. Perillo, Ph.D., the Order of the Gavel once again revisited the constitution and bylaws regarding organizational membership. Today, there are twenty-eight undergraduate and graduate student members representing major student organizations at Virginia Tech.</p>",

Panhellenic helps to oversee events such as Homecoming, the Fraternity and Sorority Life Awards, Standards of Excellence, and Sorority Recruitment, as well as the changing\r\n and updating of the Panhellenic Constitution and Bylaws.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:x-small\"><br>\r\nOnce a year, Virginia Tech's Panhellenic Council attends the Association of Fraternal Leadership and Values, during which members are able to share ideas and attend sessions with speakers who are passionate about the affairs of women in Greek life. In past\r\n years our Panhellenic Council has won awards recognizing our excellence in recruitment, risk management, public relations, diversity, and community service. We have also won awards for having the highest Greek women's grade point average in the region.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:x-small\"><br>\r\nPanhellenic Council is an excellent way for the women of Virginia Tech's NPC sororities to get involved on campus. Delegates are the voting members of their chapters on all community-wide issues. Elected and appointed officers are able to head up different\r\n programs and work with women from all chapters to plan activities of mutual concern and interest to all sororities.&nbsp; Panhellenic Council gives women unique opportunities to work with many officials on campus and throughout the Blacksburg community. Panhellenic\r\n Council gives women the chance to be involved, not just in their individual chapter but also in the entire community, and most importantly offers unbiased support to all thirteen&nbsp;sororities on our campus.</span></p>\r\n",

They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits, rather than his family\r\n background or affluence...without regard to race, nationality, skin tone or texture of hair.

Of course, Hokie Hoedown, too: a night full of square dancing, local Appalachian music, and great homemade eats! These are just a few (and my favorite) of the many events that we host.</p>\r\n",

So, people can join from anywhere on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttendees report it is highly effective; it typically involves 8 or more people each week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if you just want to join for a short session to help you, feel free to \u201ctune in\u201d.</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = further details follow = = =<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the meeting Zoom link, contact Dr. Ed Fox (at fox@vt.edu).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnline meetings will take place at the usual time unless states otherwise: Tuesdays, 5 - 6:30pm</p>\r\n<p>If anyone wants to receive energy but is not available at that time, please email Dr. Ed Fox (<a href=\"mailto:fox@vt.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fox@vt.edu</a>) email so you can be added to the list of those who will be sent energy during that time\r\n period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the online meetings, we will use the Tong Ren approach. I will explain it at the start of each meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is a quick summary: For each person, we will call out the vertebrae or acupoints or chakras needing work, and those helping will focus on sending energy to clear the blockage there.

For more information in general about Reiki, refer to the many books and other Web sites on the topic.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p5\"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p3\"><strong>Treatment vs. Practice:</strong>&nbsp;Many people receive Reiki &quot;treatments&quot;. Some view it as a way to have assistance with their health problems, or to relax, or to get energized. However, others want more; they are\r\n the intended audience for this page. They may wish to use or practice Reiki as part of their personal efforts to heal themselves, and possibly their family and friends. That may be out of love and concern, and/or may be to create an income stream, perhaps\r\n in connection with other activities, like massage or acupuncture.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p3\"><strong>Attunement:</strong>&nbsp;Those who wish to use or practice Reiki must become &quot;attuned&quot; to Reiki, typically through some training process that includes an attunement. The attunement takes 5 minutes to an hour, depending\r\n on the situation and on the time the person becoming attuned takes to work through the experience. It needs to occur in a private and quiet place where there should not be interruptions. (However, some teach Reiki in large classes, where others can observe\r\n the process, so they can learn what to expect.) Once attuned, a person is permanently empowered as a healer - this cannot be undone, though a person can somewhat ignore the ability. Attunement is at 3 levels - 1, 2, and 3 (or sometimes more, depending on the\r\n approach/school). Most people are trained and receive attunement only at level 1. That empowers them to heal using Reiki. Such training about other aspects of Reiki practice at level 1 can take an hour or a day or two, depending on the trainee's sensitivity,\r\n background, reading, etc. Some people experience a&nbsp;<span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_s1\">cleansing period after an attunement&nbsp;</span>. Some people try to&nbsp;<span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_s1\">prepare for attunements</span>. Doing so may help one\r\n achieve more personal growth, but is not necessary. Note also that receiving attunement and training usually involves some exchange (e.g., payment) to cover the cost of resources and the investment of time. Often a Reiki teacher remains a lifelong mentor and\r\n commits to helping in the future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p3\"><strong>Advanced Studies:</strong>&nbsp;Some interested in Reiki may wish to train others, or to use Reiki as part of their personal program of spiritual growth. Often this leads to them seeking further training, and receiving\r\n attunements at other levels. This activity is a very serious one, and should only be taken by those who are mature and willing to engage in personal spiritual development and are seriously committed to helping others. Usually it takes at least 21 days after\r\n each attunement for the body to adjust, and before the next attunement can be considered. Sometimes those pursuing advanced Reiki training wind up making serious changes in their lives. To some extent they may develop sensitivities and abilities that others\r\n might consider strange, or &quot;psychic&quot;, though in my perspective these are all quite natural and available to all. Yet, as in any learning and change process, those involved must seek balance, and must fit well into the world around them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p4\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p5\"><strong>Pointers for those wanting to learn Reiki / who seek attunement</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p3\"><strong>Finding a teacher:</strong>&nbsp;To pursue Reiki at level 1, it is necessary to find a teacher. One should identify a person who you feel comfortable with and who has been certified as a Reiki teacher. There are various\r\n directories to help in this process, managed by groups like&nbsp;<span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_s1\">International Association of Reiki Professionals</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_s1\">International Center for Reiki Training</span>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_p1\"><strong><em>Author:&nbsp;</em></strong><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_s1\"><em>Edward A.

AutoBoat at VT is divided into 6 sub-teams: Mechanical, Electrical, Software, Naval Architecture/Ocean Engineering, Sail, and Marketing/ Outreach. Each contributes to the design and creation of both our autonomous sailboat and high-power electric motorboat.</p>\r\n<p>_____________<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><strong>Naval Architecture (NavArch)</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sub-team is focused on the durability, maneuverability, and seakeeping capabilities of each hull. Using Orca3D and other CAD tools, they design and optimize hull shapes around these qualities. Throughout the year, this sub-team works on hull designs, fiberglass layups, structural repairs, hull ballasting, and hydrodynamic modifications to enhance performance on the water.<br /><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><strong>Propulsion </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sub-team is responsible for the design and fabrication of each vessel's propulsion system. They utilize tools such as SailCAD and principles of airfoil theory to optimize sail shape and rigging for efficient propulsion and control while overseeing the hands-on research and construction of sails. Oversight is also required for the propulsion on the other hulls where focus on propellers, their assembly, and understanding of fluid dynamics are key to success.&nbsp;<br /><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><strong>Mechanical </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sub-team is responsible for the design and construction of the boat&rsquo;s physical structure and mechanisms, ensuring lightweight, watertight, and battle-tested capability for competition. Their workflow includes CAD modeling, MATLAB analysis, and hands-on fabrication using 3D printing, CNC machining, and laser-cutting. The Mechanical sub-team acts as the backbone of the boat, bringing together contributions from every team to form a cohesive product.<br /><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><strong>Software </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sub-team develops the autonomous navigation systems, computer vision algorithms, and control software that enable our boats to sail and navigate independently. They work with Python, C++, ROS, Gazebo, YOLO, and Docker to create an intelligent autopilot software package.<br /><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><strong>Telemetry </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sub-team develops and maintains custom ground station software to control and monitor our boats from the shore. They also maintain the full codebase for our website.<br /><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><strong>Hardware (ECE) </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sub-team develops the infrastructure to bridge the barrier between software algorithms and the real-world constraints of our boats. They design and manufacture custom PCBs; collect data from sensors and actuators; and develop low-level firmware to interface with motors, pumps, and other electromechanical systems. The Electrical sub-team&rsquo;s workflow includes PCB design in KiCAD, electronics simulations in LTSpice, embedded programming in C++, and prototype development using tools like oscilloscopes and logic analyzers.<br /><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><strong>Business</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sub-team handles team outreach, sponsor relations, budget management, and team marketing. Tasks within this sub-team seek to fill in the administrative or financial needs of the whole team. Their work in this sub-team is also in conjunction with one or more of the other technical sub-teams of AutoBoat.</span></p>\r\n<p><br />The team consists primarily of undergraduate students and is open to all academic levels and majors with no application required to join!</p>",

SWB\r\n projects engage students in real-world design, project management, construction, marketing, fundraising, and cultural experiences that focus on sustainable development for community partners. Currently, we have two international projects, Nepal and Tanzania.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Nepal</strong></div>\r\n<div>In January 2016, a group of Virginia Tech students and professors traveled to Nepal to assess the earthquake damage in the culturally Tibetan community of Dhumba.&nbsp;In partnership with the Dhumba village leaders, the SWB team decided that rehabilitation\r\n of the village irrigation system would have the greatest effect on agricultural productivity and livelihoods in the community. In June of 2016, another group of Virginia Tech students and professors traveled to the community of Dhumba to work alongside the\r\n community to implement an agricultural irrigation system. Most recently, we sent a group in 2023 to finish the irrigation ditch.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Tanzania</strong></div>\r\n<div>Our Tanzania project seeks to provide Maasai youth in the Engaruka area of Tanzania with a quality primary school education in English. The Maasai ethnic group is largely illiterate and the poorest in Tanzania in terms of economic and educational attainment.\r\n Maasai girls are typically sold by their fathers for cows and are married at puberty. If they are enrolled in school, they are protected from marriage. The Maasai are particularly disadvantaged because they only speak Ma, while the national languages are Swahili\r\n and English. The school we are helping build will be taught in English to enable students to pass the national secondary school exams, which are administered in English. Currently, very few Maasai students pass the exam because of their poor English skills.\r\n The new school will also have a dormitory for students from villages that are beyond walking distance. In 2017, SWB helped the community and a local contractor build the 1st phase of the school. The school, \u201cThe Engaruka English Medium Primary School\u201d,&nbsp;opened\r\n in January 2018. Our partners on this project are the Tanzanian Engaruka Community Initiative Organization and the US Maasai Education Foundation. During the 2017-2018 school year, the Tanzania team worked to raise enough money to fund a photovaltaic system\r\n to supply electricity for the school's dining hall. Due to heavy rains, we were not able to install the PV system during our summer trip. Instead, SWB was able to assist in the construction of guest housing, an on-site brick kiln, and general maintenance to\r\n help sustainably grow the school. In 2019, students traveled to construct a playground, and in 2022 they traveled to implement a computer lab. This past summer of 2023, students raised money for a computer lab expansion, a playground expansion, and to plant\r\n native fruit trees on the school grounds.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Local</strong></div>\r\n<div>Service Without Borders is involved with projects in and around the Blacksburg community.

Students get\r\n to work on the design and manufacturing of the chassis, suspension, braking, steering, battery pack, BMS, and solar array systems.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Who Can Join?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Anyone, regardless of major or year, is encouraged to apply to our team! We are especially looking for dedicated students who are passionate about renewable energy, vehicle design, and those who want to&nbsp; learn and contribute to the project.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Team History</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Fall 2021</span> - Hyperloop transitions to form the first SolarCar Team, but it turned out Eashan Gupta, a transfer student from GMU who was on the GMU SolarCar team, had started one just one week before. They decide\r\n to merge to start what is now SolarCar at VT. The organization mainly existed on Discord, and the team went through stages of recruitment to build the team up. Most of the early progress was organizational rather than technical.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Spring 2022</span> - The team was divided into subteams, began meeting in person every week, and went to GobblerFair to help recruit more members. SolarCar at Virginia Tech's name was officially established, a lab\r\n space was obtained in Randolph Hall, initial sponsorships were gained, and we became affiliated with the ECE department. It was a huge semester of growth for the organization.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Fall 2022</span> - SolarCar at VT became an Interdisciplinary Capstone (IDC) Project and 12 Seniors joined the team. With the efforts from Spring 2022 and the new Senior Design group, they began designing critical\r\n systems, obtaining funding, ordering parts, and moving towards our first Minimum Viable Product, the\r\n<strong>Sun Gobbler</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Spring 2023</span>&nbsp;- After the majority of the designs for the first vehicle iteration were completed in Fall 2022, most of the vehicle was manufactured and assembled this semester. Minimal testing was completed, however,\r\n and the team decided to wait another year to compete in the American Solar Challenge.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Fall 2023</span> - A group of new Senior Design students led the team in preparing the vehicle for competition. This semester, improved designs were made in order to optimize the car's performance and reliability.\r\n Simultaneously, underclassmen students began the concept generation process for the next iteration vehicle. Extensive research was conducted to determine initial high-level designs.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Spring 2024</span> - Testing was conducted at the VTTI Smart Roads to ensure system reliability and regulation compliance. The finalized designs from last semester were manufactured and assembled on the car, and the\r\n vehicle was rigorously testing at the VTTI Smart Roads to ensure compliance with the regulations. The team prepared to attend the Formula Sun Grand Prix (FSGP) race in July.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">FSGP 2024</span> - The team competed for their first time alongside 30&#43; other SolarCar teams at the FSGP race in Bowling Green, Kentucky. After passing Scrutineering, a rigorous inspection process, the team completed\r\n 163 miles on the NCM Motorsports track. This total earned us 12th of 24 Single Occupancy Vehicles (SOV). The team gained invaluable knowledge and experience from attending the competition.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Fall 2025</span> - The Sun Gobbler will continue to be tested to it's limits at VTTI to identify areas of improvement, as well as collecting data that will be used to optimize our race strategy. In parallel, the team\r\n will begin the design process for our second iteration vehicle. We'll take the collective knowledge and experience that we've gained with the Sun Gobbler and apply it to our second vehicle to maximize its potential.</p>\r\n",

These ideas will be drawn into AutoCAD or Solidworks and analyzed using the structural analysis software of SAP 2000. We will take the results of this analysis and refine and optimize the design to obtain the best design possible within the provided constraints. The design, analysis, and optimization processes will continue until the end of the fall semester. Steel will then be ordered and each bridge member will be fabricated within the Ware Lab on the Virginia Tech campus. Our team will practice assembling the bridge in order to refine the skills needed to compete at the highest level in the annual regional and national competitions.

        "description_html": "\r\n<p><strong>Goals of the Student Chapter of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists (SCACVP)</strong></p>\r\n<p>1. To provide students with regular access to veterinary pathology practices, through&nbsp;anatomical&nbsp;and&nbsp;clinical pathology practice</p>\r\n<p>2. To provide students with&nbsp;options&nbsp;for learning and solidifying previous knowledge about disease</p>\r\n<p>3. To provide students with opportunities for travel to national pathology conferences and further explore their interests</p>\r\n<p>4. To provide students with annual scholarship opportunities</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Pathology Club, in conjunction with the American College of Veterinary Pathologists, has several ways in which students can gain experience in this career path including weekly histopathology rounds, weekly necropsy rounds, and weekend necropsy shadowing.\r\n Currently, there are no dues or attendance requirements. Only enrolled students of the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, who are also in good standing with the college, may enroll in the SCACVP.</p>\r\n<h3>Histopathology Rounds</h3>\r\n<p>Every Monday at 12:00 pm, a pathologist or pathology resident presents histopathology slides from a previous case in which they were involved. Students are allowed the opportunity to view the slide along with the pathologist, and to discuss the various aspects\r\n of the case and identify specific features of the tissues presented on the slides. Students are always encouraged to ask questions and engage with the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Necropsy Rounds</h3>\r\n<p>Every Friday at 12:30 pm and 4:00 pm, gross anatomical specimens are presented from necropsy cases received at the hospital throughout the week. Cases are discussed and lesions are identified as students get the chance to observe anatomical pathology associated\r\n with various disease processes.</p>\r\n<h3>Necropsy Shadowing</h3>\r\n<p>Club members have the opportunity to sign up for weekend necropsy shifts to &quot;shadow a pathologist,&quot; and find out more about the exciting things that happen back in the necropsy lab. The student will be called to assist in the necropsy if a specimen becomes\r\n available. When called, the student will arrive at the necropsy room with coveralls, name tag, and boots, unless otherwise specified. It is great practice for 4th year clinics and a great hands on learning experience for all years.</p>\r\n<p><em>It is the right of the officers to revoke a member's privileges to attend necropsy shadowing if that member repeatedly fails to show for necropsies on assigned weekends.</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Bob and Sue Duncan Memorial 5K Race</strong></p>\r\n<p>Dr. Duncan was a beloved professor of pathology at VMCVM. Upon his passing, his family, including Dr. Sue Duncan decided to establish the Bob Duncan Memorial 5K Race. The race is held each year by the SCACVP in memory of Dr. Duncan. All proceeds from the\r\n race are donated to the Bob Duncan Memorial Scholarship, which is awarded every year to a 4th Year veterinary student who has shown sustained interest and dedication in veterinary pathology. The race was redubbed the Bob and Sue Duncan Memorial 5k in 2023,\r\n following Dr. Sue Duncan's unfortunate passing both to commemorate the years she has spent to preserve the memory of Dr. Bob Duncan, as well as to commemorate her own legacy at Virginia Tech.</p>\r\n",

        "summary": "The SLC is an advisory committee for Student Affairs leadership that exists to discuss student issues, provide input on campus life and projects, and offer student leadership/views to improve student life at Virginia Tech.",
        "description_html": "<p>The Student Life Council at Virginia Tech serves as an advisory group for Student Affairs. The Student Life Council (SLC) is led by a student chair and consists of a diverse committee of up to 20 students. The SLC meets monthly to discuss relevant student issues, provide input on emerging projects important to campus life, and offer counsel related to policy, practice, and the aspirations for student learning. In addition, since Student Affairs co-chairs the Virginia Tech/Town of Blacksburg &ldquo;Town-Gown&rdquo; committee with the Blacksburg Deputy Town Manager, SLC members participate in monthly Town-Gown Meetings as part of their membership on the SLC.<br /><br />In consultation with the student chair, the Dean of Students appoints council members for an academic year (May to May). The Council meets once monthly; on selected Thursday afternoons from 5:00-7:30 pm for dinner and discussion from 5:00 - 6:30 pm&nbsp; prior to attending a monthly Town-Gown meeting from 6:30-7:30. Since the primary purpose of the Student Life Council is advisory, there is minimal time commitment beyond the required meetings described above. Council members, however, will be frequently informed of optional activities where student input is needed.<br /><br />Students interested in serving on the 2024-2025 Student Life Council should submit an application via GobblerConnect.&nbsp;<strong>Applications will be open from 8 am on Monday, April 8 to 11:59 PM on Wednesday, April 17</strong></p>\r\n<p>Students must be in good standing with Virginia Tech and the application involves a check of academic and conduct standing. Interested students must have a robust interest in strengthening campus life at Virginia Tech, and commit to being available during the times outlined above for a period between August 2024 and May 2025. Questions about the Student Life Council can be directed to our student chair Ashlyn O'Neill at ashlynoneill@vt.edu&nbsp;</p>",

We create change by bringing young people together and creating safe spaces for\r\n students of all political and ideological stripes to have honest conversations about drugs and drug policy. Founded in 1998, SSDP comprises thousands of members at hundreds of campuses in countries around the globe. &nbsp;SSDP mobilizes and empowers young people\r\n to participate in the political process, pushing for sensible policies to achieve a safer and more just future, while fighting back against counterproductive Drug War policies, particularly those that directly harm students and youth.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Current campaigns include raising awareness for our recently passed medical amnesty policy on campus, working towards increasing access for a life saving drug called naloxone for people in the community, increasing peer education for drug information, and\r\n many more. Ending the drug war is a very important goal that we are constantly working towards, and we always welcome passionate students to come to meetings, have fun, share information, and help spread the word about this very important issue.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you are interested in the club, please contact our main point of contact found on the home page and ask to be added to the listserv.

Through collaboration with the students of various majors, faculty, staff, and administration, we aim to establish a more sustainable future at Virginia Tech.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">As our Mission Statement touches on, we focus our energy on a three-fold approach to enacting change on Virginia Tech\u2019s campus. First and foremost we exist as an interest group for like-minded individuals to collectively learn\r\n and discuss sustainability-related issues around the globe. We then work to take that knowledge and spread it throughout the community via tabling, educational panels, and trips to environmentally-related sites (everywhere from Mountaintop Removal Coal mining\r\n sites to top-of-the-line sustainability showcase sites like the Bristol Energy Center).</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Enacting Change</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">On top of developing a close-knit group through team activities and social events, our weekly meetings typically consist of sharing environmental news, facilitating discussion about pressing issues, and working in project groups.\r\n Other events include debates, hosting lectures, and documentary screenings aimed at educating and inspiring.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">One of the main ways our club works to advance Virginia Tech\u2019s environmental mindfulness is through \u201cGreen RFPs\u201d. The Office of Sustainability (OS) accepts project proposals for green-focused initiatives to fund and implement\r\n on campus every November, so in the past this has been the focus of most of the work we typically engage in during the Fall semester. Spring semester typically focuses on annual events such as arbor day and earth week! Other ways Students for Sustainable Practices\r\n makes our mission known is through tabling events through the Blacksburg Farmer's Market<br>\r\n</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Let\u2019s get to work and bring more sustainable practice to VT, continuing to be an example as a progressive and prestigious institution for universities everywhere.</span></p>\r\n",

We get people to ask the all-important question, 'What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail?' and then help them to achieve\r\n those goals.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>With 409 current members and 87 alumni in the Virginia Tech chapter, we are thrilled to welcome more individuals into our community!</p>\r\n<p>If you're interested in learning more, join our interest GroupMe here:&nbsp;<a title=\"Original URL: https://groupme.com/join_group/103358834/EDfUsPRD.

Because Virginia Tech is a Senior Military College (SMC), cadets who wish to pursue a commission in the Coast Guard get exclusive access to apply for the <strong>USCG Direct Commission Selected School (DCSS) program</strong> which reduces initial officer training from <strong>12 weeks to 5 weeks!</strong>&nbsp;Participation in AUP also provides significant benefits when applying for these officer programs as it puts you well above other applicants without this experience.</p>\r\n<p>- Not all students plan to commission, and we are still committed to assisting all of our students in finding private or public sector jobs that they are passionate about.</p>\r\n<p>- Another unique benefit of the Coast Guard Auxiliary University Program is access to amazing internships with active duty Coast Guard units! You could spend your summer doing boat operations at a small boat station, learning search and rescue (SAR) operations at a Sector headquarters, getting to fly in helicopters at an Air Station, or being out on the ocean on a cutter. The opportunities are endless and are only available through the Coast Guard Auxiliary University Program.</p>",

We provide education and training on overdose prevention, naloxone distribution, safer use practices, and other life-saving interventions. By equipping students with the knowledge and skills to engage in compassionate, nonjudgmental care, we prepare future healthcare professionals to serve marginalized populations effectively. Our group actively supports harm reduction and street medicine initiatives by recruiting and organizing volunteers for safer-supply kit building, syringe service programs, and mobile health efforts. Through these initiatives, we not only expand access to vital services but also advocate for policies that promote the well-being of individuals affected by substance use and homelessness. We welcome students from all backgrounds and disciplines who share our commitment to reducing harm and expanding equitable healthcare access. By working together, we aim to create a more informed, compassionate, and supportive environment for all members of our community.</p>",

        "description_html": "<p data-start=\"243\" data-end=\"546\">The Virginia Tech Hokies hockey team was formed in the fall of 1984 as a local men&rsquo;s league team based out of the LancerLot ice arena in Vinton, Virginia, just outside of Roanoke. At the time, the university provided a $500 stipend and granted permission to use the Virginia Tech logo on the uniforms.</p>\r\n<p data-start=\"548\" data-end=\"776\">The Hokies played their first full intercollegiate schedule in the 1985 season after being accepted into the Southern Collegiate Hockey Association (SCHA), which included thirteen other member schools split into two divisions:</p>\r\n<ul data-start=\"778\" data-end=\"997\">\r\n<li data-start=\"778\" data-end=\"904\">\r\n<p data-start=\"780\" data-end=\"904\"><strong data-start=\"780\" data-end=\"802\">Northern Division:</strong> Virginia Tech, North Carolina, Duke, North Carolina State, Liberty, Old Dominion, and George Mason.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li data-start=\"905\" data-end=\"997\">\r\n<p data-start=\"907\" data-end=\"997\"><strong data-start=\"907\" data-end=\"929\">Southern Division:</strong> Florida, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Tennessee, Vanderbilt, and Emory.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p data-start=\"999\" data-end=\"1239\">Because ice time was too expensive, practices were often held on dry land or on local ponds when they froze. The Hokies&rsquo; first full season ended with a 6-8-2 record, which was considered a success as it laid the foundation for the future.</p>\r\n<h3 data-start=\"1246\" data-end=\"1302\">ACHA Formation and Facility Challenges (1991&ndash;1995)</h3>\r\n<p data-start=\"1303\" data-end=\"1560\">In 1991, the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) was formed as the national governing body for collegiate club-level ice hockey in the United States. Teams were split into Division I, II, or III, with the Hokies and the SCHA joining Division II.</p>\r\n<p data-start=\"1562\" data-end=\"1886\">In the spring of 1993, a massive snowstorm caused the structural collapse of the Hokies&rsquo; home arena, putting the team&rsquo;s future in jeopardy. Fortunately, that summer the Roanoke Civic Center was upgraded into a full-time ice arena&mdash;part of an effort to attract an ECHL team&mdash;and became the Hokies&rsquo; new home for years to come.</p>\r\n<p data-start=\"1888\" data-end=\"2277\">In 1995, the Northern Division teams of the SCHA broke off to form the Atlantic Coast Collegiate Hockey League (ACCHL), which included Virginia Tech, North Carolina, Duke, North Carolina State, Liberty, Old Dominion, and newcomers Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth. The Hokies thrived in the ACCHL&rsquo;s inaugural season, posting a 13-1 record and capturing their first league championship.</p>\r\n<h3 data-start=\"2284\" data-end=\"2341\">Championship Runs and League Transition (2009&ndash;2011)</h3>\r\n<p data-start=\"2342\" data-end=\"2470\">In 2009, the Hokies went undefeated in ACCHL play (9-0) and captured another league championship, finishing the season 18-6-1.</p>\r\n<p data-start=\"2472\" data-end=\"2579\">In 2010, they repeated as ACCHL champions with a 6-1 league record, ultimately finishing the year 15-4-3.</p>\r\n<p data-start=\"2581\" data-end=\"3000\">That summer, the program moved to the tougher Mid-Atlantic Collegiate Hockey Association (MACHA) with the goal of competing at a higher regional and national level. In their first MACHA season (2010-11), the Hokies earned their highest-ever Southeast regional ranking (#4) and won the inaugural MACHA South Championship by defeating Liberty 4-3 in the title game&mdash;making it three straight championships across leagues.</p>\r\n<p data-start=\"3002\" data-end=\"3201\">The Hokies finished the 2010-11 season ranked #6 in the Southeast and advanced to the ACHA Southeast Regional Tournament, where they fell 2-1 to Penn State, ending the season with a 19-12-2 record.</p>\r\n<h3 data-start=\"3208\" data-end=\"3258\">National Tournament Breakthrough (2011&ndash;2013)</h3>\r\n<p data-start=\"3259\" data-end=\"3394\">The MACHA later changed its abbreviation to MACH to avoid confusion with another league, while keeping its North and South divisions.</p>\r\n<p data-start=\"3396\" data-end=\"3707\">In 2011-12, the Hokies entered the ACHA Southeast Regional Tournament as the #7 seed. After defeating Kennesaw State 7-5, they upset Liberty 5-3 to advance to their first-ever ACHA National Tournament in Ft. Myers, Florida, finishing the season ranked #12 in the nation out of nearly 180 Division II programs.</p>\r\n<p data-start=\"3709\" data-end=\"4056\">The following season, the Hokies finished third in the MACH South during the regular season but went on a remarkable playoff run, defeating Liberty, UMBC, and Penn State to capture their first combined MACH Championship. They reached the Southeast Regional semifinals before falling to Bowling Green, narrowly missing a return trip to Nationals.</p>\r\n<h3 data-start=\"4063\" data-end=\"4115\">Return to ACCHL and Recent Success (2018&ndash;2023)</h3>\r\n<p data-start=\"4116\" data-end=\"4233\">The Hokies returned to their original home rink, the LancerLot, and rejoined the ACCHL starting in the 2018 season.</p>\r\n<p data-start=\"4235\" data-end=\"4355\">In 2021-22, they won the ACCHL regular-season championship before falling in the semifinals of the playoff tournament.</p>\r\n<h3 data-start=\"4362\" data-end=\"4404\">Modern Era Milestones (2024&ndash;Present)</h3>\r\n<ul data-start=\"4405\" data-end=\"4989\">\r\n<li data-start=\"4405\" data-end=\"4537\">\r\n<p data-start=\"4407\" data-end=\"4537\"><strong data-start=\"4407\" data-end=\"4427\">January 4, 2025:</strong> The Hokies played and won their first-ever outdoor game, shutting out UNC 6-0 at Truist Field in Charlotte.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li data-start=\"4538\" data-end=\"4655\">\r\n<p data-start=\"4540\" data-end=\"4655\"><strong data-start=\"4540\" data-end=\"4559\">2024-25 Season:</strong> Finished with a 24-4-1 overall record, one of the most successful seasons in program history.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li data-start=\"4656\" data-end=\"4834\">\r\n<p data-start=\"4658\" data-end=\"4834\"><strong data-start=\"4658\" data-end=\"4683\">Coaching Achievement:</strong> Head Coach Joey Mullen, in his 15th season, surpassed 200 career wins, becoming the winningest coach in both Virginia Tech hockey and ACCHL history.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li data-start=\"4835\" data-end=\"4989\">\r\n<p data-start=\"4837\" data-end=\"4989\"><strong data-start=\"4837\" data-end=\"4852\">Postseason:</strong> Returned to the Southeast Regional Tournament for the first time in five years, falling in double overtime to Ohio in the first round.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p data-start=\"4996\" data-end=\"5179\">Once again, the Hokies look to continue their winning ways heading into the <strong data-start=\"5072\" data-end=\"5090\">2025-26 season</strong>.

In the&nbsp;<strong>Dental&nbsp;Outreach&nbsp;program</strong>, interns learn about healthcare in a global context. Through shadowing local dentists, interns will also learn about dental procedures, treatment\r\n courses, clinic operations, and disinfection and sanitation techniques.</p>\r\n<p>Interns will prepare for their trip throughout the year by attending team training sessions, participating in local community service projects, and developing team building activities, led by their&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.vawglobal.org/?page_id=78\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Team\r\n Leader</a>&nbsp;</strong>or Faculty Team Leader. Interns are required to attend trainings and workshops prior to their trip, so that they are well prepared upon arrival in country.</p>\r\n<p>This is an intensive internship \u2014 valuable to future dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, as well as other future healthcare providers, global practitioners, and anyone interested in gaining skills in public health while supporting healthcare\r\n systems around the world.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>While on-site, interns will be required to attend several orientations and workshops focused on professional development and cultural sensitivity, which will reinforce the trainings they did leading up to their trip. Additionally, interns will be required\r\n to demonstrate proficiency in clinical skills, such as measuring blood pressure, biosecurity and biosafety measures, and other skills \u2014 approved by a local healthcare provider \u2014 before being allowed to assist in those stations during clinics.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout their time in-country, and especially while in clinic, it is of utmost importance that interns portray health care realities and burden of disease accurately, show professionalism, and respect patients privacy and integrity at all times. During\r\n clinics, interns will be placed each day in one of following stations:</p>\r\n<h3>Intake</h3>\r\n<p>Interns will greet patients as they come into clinic, collect their personal and medical history, and record their current symptoms. They will work with local community leaders, VAW Global staff, and, in some countries, translators. They will record all\r\n of the information for the dentist\u2019s review.</p>\r\n<h3>Vitals</h3>\r\n<p>Interns will measure patients\u2019 vital signs, including blood pressure, under the direct supervision of a locally licensed nurse, physician, or other local healthcare provider. Interns must have tested out of training in order to participate in this station.</p>\r\n<h3>Consultation</h3>\r\n<p>Interns will have the opportunity to learn about dental procedures and treatment courses by shadowing and assisting locally licensed dentists. If the patient allows, interns will have the opportunity to shadow the consultation and listen as the dentist meets\r\n with the patient, does an oral exam, completes the procedures, prescribes treatment (if necessary), and gives general advice; interns will have the opportunity to assist the dentist during the procedure by procuring and passing instruments, among other tasks.\r\n This station really provides interns who are engaged and interested with an incredible opportunity to learn healthcare in a global context.</p>\r\n<h3>Sterilization and Tray Preparation</h3>\r\n<p>Interns will apply cold and hot sterilization techniques for the instruments utilized in consultation. Interns will learn about different instruments, their names, and their usages; they will apply this knowledge to prepare the instrument trays for consultation\r\n for an array of procedures. Interns must have passed through the VAW Global Biosafety Protocol Training and Exam prior to participating in this station.</p>\r\n<h3>Professional Development Activity</h3>\r\n<p>On the two week trip, interns may have the opportunity to participate in an impressions and tooth waxing workshop, which&nbsp;provides an opportunity to learn about the morphology of teeth and develop hand skills.</p>\r\n<h3>Cross-Cultural Education Day</h3>\r\n<p>Cultural Exchange Day is an opportunity to share the richness of North American culture with children while engaging them in fun, interactive activities.</p>\r\n<h3>In-Country Schedule</h3>\r\n<p>VAW Global Dental Outreach offers two trip lengths: two weeks (15 days) or one week (7 days). On the two week trip, there will be six clinic days; on the one week trip, there will be three clinic days. Each country varies slightly in how the schedule is\r\n arranged and what opportunities are available.</p>\r\n<p>All interns are responsible for covering their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vawglobal.org/?page_id=72\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>program fees</strong></a>,&nbsp;medication and supply fund fee, plane tickets, spending money, and any additional\r\n expenses.</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>VAW Global Health Alliances constantly strives to provide the best quality patient care for our communities and the best professional development opportunities for our interns.

At the undergraduate level, industrial and systems engineers learn elements from each specialty and employ them\r\n all in the workforce. At the graduate level, these specialties diverge and have their own student groups. Many groups at the graduate level (see HFES, INFORMS, etc.) focus on specific specialty areas and not the full breadth of ISE.&nbsp;It is our belief that a\r\n mixed grad/undergrad group maintaining the connections between specialties further ensures well-rounded engineers and better mentorship for curious undergraduate students considering each specialty. The hope is also to build a group of WISE-alum with whom\r\n current students can connect with and seek mentorship.</p>\r\n<p>Follow us on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vt_women_ise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\r\nInstagram</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/women-in-ise-wise-04b583298/\">\r\nLinkedIn</a>!</p>\r\n",

        "description_html": "\r\n<p>The major characteristic which makes fraternities differ from one another is the type of individual involved. In Zeta Psi, we firmly believe in this concept. The Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America was founded in 1847 with the ideals of developing young\r\n men into purposeful, free-thinking, community-minded individuals. We are smaller than some of the other fraternities in the Interfraternity Conference (IFC), but we have many great accomplishments under our belts. Zeta Psi became the first truly national fraternity,\r\n when we started our chapter at the University of California at Berkley in 1870. We also became the first international fraternity when the chapter at the University of Toronto was started in 1879. Other firsts include the first fraternity at all eight Ivy\r\n League schools simultaneously, and the first fraternity on the campuses of Tufts, Cornell, Berkeley, Toronto, McGill, Case Western Reserve, Stanford, Alberta, Calgary, Claremont, and the University of Manitoba.&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe put a strong emphasis on the individual, not only in recruitment and training, but in career development, alumni affiliation, and lifelong participation. We want our brother to feel that he is a stronger individual for his association with us, not simply\r\n a member of a group.&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are often called the &quot;Ivy League Fraternity&quot;. As Zeta Psi chapters spread across the North American continent, we did not stray from our original mission. We have approximately 60 active chapters throughout the United States and Canada. Our chapter roll\r\n speaks for itself. We maintain our selective group by choice, rather than compromise the integrity of our brotherhood. Zeta Psi has built a reputation for establishing chapters at only the premier academic institutions in the U.S. and Canada. No other fraternity\r\n can match this impressive list.&quot;&nbsp;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Courtesy of the University of Manitoba's Zeta Psi site</p>\r\n",
